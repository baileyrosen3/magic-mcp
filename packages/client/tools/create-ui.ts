## Shadcn/ui instructions
After you add the component, make sure to add the component to the project. If you can't resolve components from demo code,
Make sure to install shadcn/ui components from the demo code missing imports

Examples of importing shadcn/ui components:
if these imports can't be resolved:
${"```tsx"}
import {
  Table
} from "@/components/ui/table"
import { Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea"
${"```"}

then run this command:
${"```bash"}
npx shadcn@latest add table textarea
${"```"}`;

      return {
        content: [
          {
            type: "text" as const,
            text: responseToUser,
          },
        ],
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error executing tool", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
